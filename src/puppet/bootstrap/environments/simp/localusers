# This file houses a list of local users specified by system, that should apply
# to your hosts.
#
# The format is:
# [!|+|-]<fqdn-regex>,<username>,<uid>,<gid>,[<homedir>],<password/MD5 hash>
#
# If you add a '!' to the beginning of an entry, the user will have its
# password expiration set so that it never expires.
#
# If you add a '+' to the beginning of an entry the user will retain its
# existing password expiration entries.
#
# If you add a '-' to the beginning of the entry, the user and associated group
# will be deleted from the system unless the uid is 0.
#
# <fqdn> is a regular expression that may follow one of the following formats:
#     /regex/opts,<username>
#     /regex/,<username>
#     regex,<username>
#     *.<domain>,<username>
#     fqdn,<username>
#
# 'homedir' is the optional home directory of the user.  If nothing is
# specified, then the system default will be used.
#
# The *first* entry in the file will be used.
#
# It is highly recommended that you do not change the uid or gid after first
# assignment unless absolutely necessary. The utility will change the entries
# but may result in unowned files on your system if you are not extremely
# careful.
#
# Do *not* assign the group for these users to a network-based primary group.
# If you need the user to be in a network system (LDAP/NIS) then add them to a
# supplementary group.
