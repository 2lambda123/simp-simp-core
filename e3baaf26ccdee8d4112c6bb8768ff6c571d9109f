The patch fixes the issue by bringing all EL versions to\n    `6.8`, future-proofing the BinTray tarball link, and correcting other\n    minor errors.\n\n\n    SIMP-1342 #close #comment Brought 4.2.X README up-to-date\n\n\n- A good template for commit message descriptions can be found in Puppet\u0027s contribution policy: https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-changes\n- A starter SIMP commit message template can be found at https://simp-project.atlassian.net/wiki/display/SD/Contributing+to+SIMP",
