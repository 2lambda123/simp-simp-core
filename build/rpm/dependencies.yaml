# This file holds a list of RPM dependencies/obsoletes/releases/external
# dependencies that apply to Puppet module RPMs.  Module entries in this
# file are needed when any of the following conditions occur:
#
# (1) We need to specify a release qualifier (package version).
#     - This is necessary for components that have not changed since
#       they were released with a release version of '2016', the
#       default release version used when building SIMP-6.0.0 RPMs.
#       (The current default is '0'.)
#     - This is necessary when we need to specify RPM metadata-only
#       package changes, such as a change in puppet module
#       dependencies, obsoletes, or external dependencies.
#
# (2) We need to specify an obsoletes.
#     This is required when a project has changed owner and
#     the RPM name will change from pupmod-<old owner>-<module name>
#     to pupmod-<new owner>-<module name>.
#
# (3) We want to restrict the dependencies.
#     This is useful when modules require modules for OS's other
#     than RedHat/CentOS or require modules that conflict with SIMP
#     capabilities. We don't really need the dependencies in this
#     case, and excluding them has no impact on SIMP system
#     operations.
#
# (4) We want to add external dependencies, i.e., dependencies
#     that are not Puppet modules.
#
# For all modules listed in this file,
# * The RPM obsoletes will be pulled from this file.
# * The RPM dependency names will be pulled from this file.
# * The depedency versions will be pulled directly from the
#   metadata.json file in the module.
#
# For all other modules
# * The module will have no RPM obsoletes.
# * Both the RPM dependency names and versions will be pulled
#   from the metadata.json file in the module.
#
# IMPORTANT ADDITIONAL NOTES:
# (1) One of the main reasons this global file exists, instead of
#     storing this information in each project, itself, is because we
#     need to build RPMs of non-SIMP components from their respective
#     GitHub projects. Maintaining this information in SIMP-owned
#     forks of non SIMP-components has shown to be untenable.
#
# (2) Any time the version of a non-SIMP component changes, you **MUST**
#     evaluate if that change results in the addition of, removal of,
#     or change to an entry in this file.
#
# (3) Each entry **MUST** remain in this file until a newer version
#     of the component is to be released.  This is because the
#     ISO-building process may create a different RPM for the same
#     version of this component, potentially with incorrect RPM
#     metadata, instead of using the existing, released RPM.
#
# (4) This file is only used for simp-rake-helpers >= 5.3.0
